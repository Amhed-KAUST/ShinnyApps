### ShinnyApps
## Porpouse
In this repository I intent to store R apps that are meant to run in the desktop unix computer I work on. The basic idea is to save a shell script that later will be run in a newworkspace and that will containg forwground R commands which specifies the shinny App to run and its port (to provide local access).
